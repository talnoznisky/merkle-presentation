### Final thoughts


- Focus on specific quantifiable targets, but not at the expense of longterm optimization opportunity.


- Create secure, rapid deployment techniques, and be conscious of comparable data collection.


- Document new feature development decisions for your application, in especially reproducible detail for back-up support on critical functions.
